A-U# 01    Eonnot: Erkind Nos   4.15.20


Erkind Nos is the name of a collection of songs but also a name belonging to the canals. The canals named "Nos Nos Nos Nos Nos Nos Nos," meaning "This is what we wish to make into the canal."
        Erkind Nos is the name of a collection of songs but also the eleventh title of a series of three string quartets, which is believed to have been composed by Ernst Nos in 1844, in Leipzig, Germany. 3912 Alllied Songs in E (or the E-String Quartet).
        Erkind Nos is the name of a collection of songs but also can be translated as a series of songs about a main character's demise. A particular composition features Leonard, who was killed off during a Season finale. Leonard says: "The XreWo is my favourite point of view. XreWo is my hard boiled soul. And your hard boiled soul. XreWo is the only one to scream it out loud."


Pretty much sums it up. 


        Leonard will be gone, and the songs will know his story. Behind the laughter we also get a song from Lenny(the dog) in an episode with the same name, but it is not a proper song. This song may have been inspired by Leonard or 4809 Awesome Cassette Works. The Count, Elephants in the Night, Instant Classic, Heart's Automatic, and So & So's Return all appear on "Better Let Go" Cassette Works.

In a perfect world, we could have this system here tomorrow morning, right now, but I can assure you that we're not going to be making these decisions on a whim or a group of people over there.

        Imagine a vault that has thousands of little keys, and to open that vault you need a passphrase.
