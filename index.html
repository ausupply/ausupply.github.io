A particular composition features Leonard, who was killed off during a Season finale. Leonard says: "The XreWo is my favourite point of view. XreWo is my hard boiled soul. And your hard boiled soul. XreWo is the only one to scream it out loud."</p></td>

This song may have been inspired by Leonard or 4809 Awesome Cassette Works. The Count, Elephants in the Night, Instant Classic, Heart's Automatic, and So & So's Return all appear on "Better Let Go" Cassette Works.</p></td>
